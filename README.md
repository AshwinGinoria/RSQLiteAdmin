## Why SQLite

SQLite is a serverless solution that’s self-contained, highly reliable, and full of features. As a self-contained SQL database engine, it can handle all sorts of data in a relatively simple manner. This is because it integrates directly with the application instead of having to install it somewhere and then have it connect with your app. 

Pros:

 1. Serverless which means it is simple to set up and zero configuration is required
 2. File-based system makes it very portable
 3. Great for development and testing

Cons:

 1. Doesn’t provide network access (i.e. accessing it from another machine) as it is serverless
 2. Not built for large-scale applications
 3. No user management
