| SQL is Structured Query Language which is used with databases like MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2, etc. It is not a database itself. | SQLite is a portable database resource. You have to get an extension of SQLite in whatever language you are programming in to access that database. You can access all of the desktop and mobile applications. |
